# JavaScript Basics - Day 3 Exercises

This repository contains the exercises for **Day 3** of the 4-day introductory JavaScript course. The exercises focus on control structures in JavaScript, specifically loops and conditional statements, which are crucial for handling repetitive tasks and making decisions in your code.

## Topics Covered

- **Loops**  
  Using various types of loops:

  - **for**: The classic loop for iterating a specific number of times.
  - **for of**: Ideal for iterating over the elements of an iterable object (like arrays or strings).
  - **while**: A loop that continues to execute as long as a specific condition is true.
  - **forEach**: A method specifically for iterating over arrays, with simpler syntax.

- **if/else**  
  Conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to execute different code blocks depending on certain conditions.
